An electrocardiogram (ECG) is the graphical representation of electrical 
impulses due to ionic activity in the cardiac muscles of the human heart. The
fundamental goal of data compression is efficient transmission or storage while 
preserving significant diagnostic features.
There are three transformation techniques such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), 
Discrete Cosine Transform ( DCT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT). These 
techniques are employed for ECG signal compression.
DCT has been widely used for data compression. DCT gives the decomposed coefficient of 
the original signal. Applying DCT to the sampled ECG signal gives DCT coefficients, 
which give energy of each component of the signal. Based on the requirement of 
energy in the compressed signal, the unwanted components can be removed resulting 
in a compressed ECG signal which is storage efficient.
